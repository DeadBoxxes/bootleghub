  <hr><p>here are <i>some</i> things i own, games and systems... this list might rarely update... so i may forget to add things i own here
  <mark>PHOTOS COMING SOON!!!</mark></p>
  <li>GAME CONSOLE - a bootleg Nintendo Switch themed handheld, runs basic nes hardware, very recent and can be found on retail sites like TEMU, and maybe amazon...</li>
  <li>POWER PLAYER SUPER JOY III - a modern version i have, ill have to add a photo but mine is much more uncommon, i havent seen another one like mine... mine has a different box with "Y2K" and other unique things on it, it only boasts 75 games, and the controller is different, a design usually moulded into plastic is printd on, an the A and B buttons are not the same size as the other start and select buttons, my version has the A, B, and A B turbo buttons in the shape and size of the C buttons, even with the arrows.</li>
  <li>MIWI - a wii clone console, many versions exist, mine runs VT03-alike hardware, and all games have prerecorded music and sounds... i have not found another version of mine that is the same, and my box has both english and french on it, because im a buck-sniping, rootbeer drinkin Canadian.. cool eh?</li>
  <li>RANDOM "MY ARCADE" HANDHELD - i forgot the name of it, i got one from my grandma a long, long time ago at christmas... it sadly btoke a year-or so later, so i asked for a new one and got it, i forget how i got my second one, but im glad i got it as it has LOTS of games and even has that "Fishing" Nice Code game that is SUPER similar to the Hummer Team "King Fishing" Game...</li>
  <li>NATSUME 150 in 1 - a multicart by natsume, i think, the cart is red and is not a famicom but nes cartridge! it does have 150 games, no repeats, and includes the bootleg Super Game Lion King and Hummer Team aladdin, this version doesnt swap A and B controls however, but it still feels Okay to play.</li>
<br><br><br>
  MORE SOON! i hope...
